## Project Overview

This project simulates and analyzes a SYN flood Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack using Wireshark. It was completed as part of a cybersecurity training exercise to demonstrate the ability to identify, investigate, and respond to abnormal network traffic patterns.

A SYN flood attack exploits the TCP handshake by sending a high volume of SYN packets to a server without completing the connection, leaving the server overwhelmed with half-open connections. This prevents legitimate users from accessing web services and can cause serious service disruption.

### What's Included

- A sample Wireshark TCP/HTTP log showing the SYN flood in progress
- A cybersecurity incident report summarizing the attack and response
- Supporting documentation to help interpret TCP packet data
- Key lessons on detecting and mitigating DoS attacks

This repository highlights practical incident response and traffic analysis skills useful for entry-level cybersecurity and SOC roles.
